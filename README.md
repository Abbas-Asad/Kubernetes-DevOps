# Kubernetes-DevOps
Welcome to my learning journey in Kubernetes and DevOps! This repository documents my progress from zero to mastering containerization, orchestration, and cloud-native technologies. My goal is to become a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and Security Specialist (CKS), building hands-on skills through real-world projects.
<!-- 
## About This Repo
This is my personal learning hub where I:
- Practice core DevOps concepts (Linux, Git, CI/CD, IaC).
- Build projects with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Document my learnings and challenges to grow as a cloud-native engineer.

Currently in **Phase 1**: Mastering Linux fundamentals and Bash scripting.

## Current Skills
- **Linux**: Learning commands, file systems, and scripting.
- **Git**: Version control basics with GitHub.
- **Next Up**: Docker for containerization, followed by Kubernetes.

## Projects
